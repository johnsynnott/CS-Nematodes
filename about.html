She is originally from New Hampshire but re-located to Worcester, MA in 2009 when she began attending WPI. She obtained her BS in Biology and Biotechnology in 2013 from the university. Laura began her work with nematodes in early 2013 when she completed her major qualifying project in the Srinivasan Lab. This project focused on soil nematode biodiversity in the Central Massachusetts region, an area of biodiversity that was previously untouched. Laura has decided to continue this project in her new role in the Srinivasan Lab along with her other lab duties.</div>

              <div class="span10">Professor Jagan Srinivasan was originally born and raised in India. He completed his undergraduate course work at the University of Chennai earning a BS in Zoology and Chemistry. He then moved on to his MS at Goa University completing a degree in Marine Biology and Biotechnology. Professor Srinivasan thereupon relocated to Tuebingen, Germany where he completed his Ph.D in Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology. His postdoctoral research soon after sent him to Pasadena, California where he studied the evolution of behavior in C. elegans at the California Institute of Technology and further-more small-molecule metabolites regulating social behaviors in C. elegans at Caltech. After his time in Pasadena, in 2012, Professor Srinivasan moved to the opposite side of the country where he now is an Assistant Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, MA. While simultaneously teaching classes he also focuses on researching brain process signaling and social behaviors using the model system  C. elegans.</div>
